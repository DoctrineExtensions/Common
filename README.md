![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/DoctrineExtensions/Common.svg?branch=master "Build Status")

This package provides common code user among all DoctrineExtensions packages and is usually automatically required by
extensions, so you don't need to require it yourself.

Note: this code is a part of the hard fork of 
[Atlantic18/DoctrineExtensions](https://github.com/Atlantic18/DoctrineExtensions).
